- building a to-do list sites
    - it is very simple - just a list of text
    - There's no reason to be limited to just "to-do"
- FTs(functional tests) should have a human-readable story that we can follow
- unittest module give us various assertion methods and setUp/tearDown like try/finally sentense
- Firstly, we make User Stroy using comments that accompany the test code
    
## Chapter 3. Testing a Simple Home Page with Unit Tests
[url](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/test-driven-development-with/9781491958698/ch03.html)

- write a test and run the unit tests and see how they fail
- make a minimal code change to address the current test failure

## Chapter 4
- test for POST method and using Model

### Code smell: POST test is too long?
- a long unit test either needs to be broken into two, or testing is too complicated

### You should add your list of things to fix later
ex.
1. Donâ€™t save blank items for every request
2. Code smell: POST test is too long?
3. Display multiple items in the table
4. Support more than one list!
